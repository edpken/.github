私たち、情報処理研究部 ( EDP - Electronic Data Processing 研-)は主にコンピュータを使用した活動をしています。 
C言語、HTML、JavaScript、Python、C＃などのプログラミング言語を使っていて、わからないことがあれば、気軽に相談することができます。 
また、Linux(Ubuntu)のサーバーもあり、プログラムの実行方法などの基本的なことからサーバー管理やOSS(Open Source Software)の導入、
外部公開などの発展的な内容も学べる機会を提供しています。 
自分が楽しめて他の部員に布教できるような作品や誰にとってもわかりやすく興味が湧く作品などを制作できるように心がけています。 
最近では情報系のセキュリティ関連のイベントなどの部内告知があり、簡単に情報が得れるような環境づくりにも努めています。
